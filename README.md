My Catppuccin Mocha Lavender Hyprland setup!


## Video and Screenshot

You can find a quick recording [here](https://youtu.be/HOTUgxzeMoE).

You can also find the [original video file](./assets/Recording.mp4) in the ```assets``` directory.


## Credits

- Waybar config based on the one from [m4xshen's dotfiles](https://github.com/m4xshen/dotfiles).

- Screenshot and GTK Theme scripts are based on [Arcolinux](https://arcolinux.com/) ones.

- Firefox CSS is a Catppuccinified version of [WhiteSur Firefox Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-firefox-theme).

- Colors section of kitty config is a tweaked version of [Catppuccin for Kitty](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty).

- The zsh theme is tweaked [fox](https://github.com/trusktr/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/fox.zsh-theme) with elements from [bira](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme)

- The styling on Swaync is slightly tweaked [Catppuccin for Swaync](https://github.com/catppuccin/swaync)


## Notes

- These dotfiles were not created with the intent of others using them. You should look through at least some of the config if you plan on using it.

- The Firefox CSS only uses Catppuccin colors when using dark mode

- The ```firefox/chrome```  directory goes in your firefox profile folder

- Firefox CSS requires ```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets``` to be enabled in about:config.

- Things outside of ```.config``` go in your home folder \(Except for ```assets```, ```README.md``` and ```firefox```\).

- Some scripts are simple utility scripts and are unrelated to the setup.

- The ```assets``` directory doesn't contain anything needed for the setup.
